## Other info
Selene is a general purpose language built on top of Lua and Lpeg. This language
is designed to be a tool for students to learn the basics of implementing,
building, compiling and interpreting languages.

For this course, Roberto continuously updates the file interpreter.lua. To help
the students understand the progress of the course, each end-of-lesson version
of the file will be located in a folder called "lesson-NUMBER". The NUMBER in
the folder name represents the number of the lesson, with a total of 8 lessons
in the course. This way, students can easily compare their work with Roberto's
or refer back to previous versions of the file for any reason.

`lesson-0` folder is a clean slate.
